Despite the treatment of cancer, many results have been achieved, all these approaches have their challenges and limitations in the field of cancer therapy. Nonspecific toxicity to normal cells is one of the main challenges of conventional cancer therapy. In addition, some chemotherapeutic agents can lead to the formation of multidrug-resistant cells. 2 3 Figure1. E. coli lactate, pH and hypoxia induce regulatory mechanisms. Recent work has demonstrated that microorganisms injected directly intravenously can grow selectively in tumors without adverse effects on host health 4 5 6 . Specifically, the ability of bacteria to selectively home to tumors has increased the use of microbes as therapeutic or diagnostic possibilities 7 . In order to construct a bacterial biosensor system that can distinguish the unique organ environment, oxygen, pH and lactic acid are considered as unique indicators of colorectal cancer tumor tissue. Three operons were used to specifically recognize oxygen, pH and lactic acid. pPepT is used to sense oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, FNR binds to the \\([4Fe-4S]^{2+}\\) cluster to generate homologous dimers. However, in the presence of oxygen, \\([4Fe-4S]^{2+}\\) clusters are degraded, resulting in the dissociation of FNR dimers into inactive monomers 8 . L-lactic acid induction is based on lldPRD operon 9 .The lactic acid sensing system consists of two parts. pLldP drives the expression of interested genes. LldR repressor binds to pLldP to inhibit the expression of reporter genes, unless bound to lactic acid 10 11 . The pH-sensitive promoter pCadC, regulated by CadC, exhibits higher activity in acidic media than in neutral pH media. However, many challenges limit the clinical application of current biosensor systems. In order to enable living cells to perform complex signal processing operations, amplifying genetic switches and Boolean logic gates based on serine integrase are used in the design of biosensor systems 12 . To give the engineered strains the therapeutic ability on tumor cells, HlyE, CCL21 and CDD-iRGD are used as therapeutic parts. HlyE is testified to able to be used as a pore-forming antitumor toxin 13 . CCL21 and CDD-iRGD are able to activate the immune response of host 14 15 . In addition, the YebF tag was added to the N-end of HlyE to realize bacterial exocrine 16 . Next, the tumor cell adhesion module was designed: HlpA can improve the penetration of engineered bacteria into colorectal tumor cells 17 . In order to export HlpA-binding protein to the surface of EcN, shortened INP tag was fused into the N-end of HlpA 18 19 . In the end, \u03c6X174E was put into the module, which can lead to bacteria lysis and death 20 21 , resulting in the release of therapeutic factors stored inside the strain 22 23 24 .

We purchase E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) from Biobw (China, Beijing). E. coli DH5\u03b1 were deposited from laboratory. All plasmids base on the pSB1A3/pSB3T5/pSB4C5 plasmid backbone. pSB1A3 is ampicillin resistant and carries the highcopy replicon ColE1; pSB3T5 is tetracycline resistant and carries the medium copy replicon p15A; pSB4C5 is chloramphenicol resistant and carries the low copy replicon pSC101. All Biobrick parts will be registered in the iGEM Standard Bioparts Registry (partsregistry.org). All amplification primers were synthesized by Tsingke (China, Beijing). We use a one-step cloning kit (C113, Vazyme, China) to assemble recombinant plasmids (constructions), including Reporter 01-03; Controller 01-06; Switch 01-06; Effector 01-03 (full HlpAmstrain information is provided in Supplementary Materials). Both Reporter and Controller use pSB1A3 as the plasmid backbone. Switch uses pSB4C5 as the plasmid backbone and Effector uses pSB3T5 as the plasmid backbone. All recombinant plasmids were first transformed into E. coli DH5\u03b1 for amplification and proofed by DNA sequencing (GENERAL Biol,Chuzhou, China), then transformed into EcN. Reporter consists of an operational unit that senses hypoxia/pH/L-lactate and an mRFP, which purpose was to verify the in vitro response of pPepT/pCaCd/lldPRD operon by fluorescent protein mRFP. Controller introduce the genes TP901 and Bxb1 encoding serine integrase to the downstream of pPepT/pCaCd/lldPRD operon to control the Amplifying genetic switches. Switch 01- 02 were composed of Amplifying genetic switches (TP901 or Bxb1 switches) and fluorescent protein mRFP; Switch 03-04 were composed of Amplifying genetic switches and lysis gene \u03c6 X174 E; Switch 05-06 were composed of Amplifying genetic switches and YebF -HlyE composition. Finally, Effector controls the expression of therapeutic proteins HlyE, CCL21 or CDD-iRGD by the constitutive promoter J23100. We transform Controller and Switch 01/02 into EcN (Amplifying reporter, AR 01-06) to check the signal amplification effect of the Amplifying genetic logic gate, and compare with the Reporter to determine the best induction-response system. We transform the Controller and Switch 05/06 verified in the previous step into EcN (Amplifying Effector, AE) to endow it with the ability to eliminate colorectal cancer. Finally, we construct LE strain (Lysis Effector), which consisted of Controller 05/06, Switch 03/04 and Effector 01-03. To check the lysis ability of \u03c6X174 E, we replace the Effector (Lysis reporter, LR) by pSB3T5 (Reporter variant, RV) constitutively expressing mRFP. Since Controller, Switch and Effector possess different replicons and resistances, that ensure the plasmid compatibility. Characterization and Analysis of Reporting Strains in Vitro We culture each strain in M9 basic medium with relevant antibiotics (supplemented with 0.4% glucose) overnight (37\u2103, 150 rpm), followed for the further experiment next morning. For lactic acid reporters (Reporter 01; AR 01/02; LR), the culture of each lactic acid reporter variant strain was transferred to a 24 well plates (6 repeats), with M9 broth diluted to 1 mL per well. The next step, the final concentration of L-lactic acid should reach 0, 0.1, 1,5 and 10 mM, by adding 25\u03bcL M9 broth containing different concentrations of L-lactic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). For pH reporter (Reporter 02, AR 03/04, LR), each variety strain needs to be cultured in the 96 well plates, and the pH value of M9 medium should be 5.5, 5.8, 6.3 and 7.3, respectively. For hypoxia reporters (Reporter 03, AR 05/06, LR), we culture each variant strain overnight under normoxic and hypoxic conditions at 37\u2103. To achieve hypoxia, reporters were incubated statically in an anaerobic pocket(Hopebiol, Qingdao, China) with oxygen indicators. We select untransformed EcN and EcN containing p23114-mRFP which grows under the same conditions as negative control and positive control respectively. The initial OD600 value of all strains is 0.1. After 16-20 hours\u2019 incubation, we detect OD600 and mRFP fluorescence through microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) (excitation \u03bb: 584nm/10 nm, emission \u03bb: 607/10nm). The fluorescence of all reporters in vitro is calculated by dividing the crude mRFP pixel intensity by OD600, and both signals we obtain from the data of microplate reader. In addition, the background fluorescence signal need to be deducted (no plasmid EcN control). For hypoxia reporters, the fluorescence signal was normalized through the control of constitutive promoter (p23114) to explain the protein folding maturation under hypoxia. The fold change of each reporter was quantified as the ratio of normalized fluorescence signal under induced and non-induced conditions. We average over all three duplicate values. The baseline conditions are 20% oxygen concentration, 0 mM lactic acid concentration, pH \\(7.3^{25}\\) . Cell culture We purchase CT-26 (murine colon cancer cells), RKO (human colon cancer cells) and SW480 (human colon cancer cells bacteria) cells from Procell (Wuhan, China). Cells were all cultured in 25 cm2 culture flasks (Corning, USA) at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. The basic culture medium is DMEM (BasalMedia , Shanghai, China), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gemini, USA) and 1% P/ S (Gibco, USA). Utility test for cell culture samples With an initial cell count of 105, cell lines Were all seeded in 25cm2 culture flask (11 repeats) containing 5ml DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum. For the next 5 days, we take out the entire contents of each bottle (two bottle of samples taken at the last time) and transfer to the 15ml sterile centrifuge tube every 8-12 hours. Centrifuge the samples for 5 minutes in 200 r.c.f., collect the supernatant from the culture medium to another centrifuge tube, freezing at -80\u00b0C. Subsequently, we inoculate 6 reporter strains (3 of selected pH, lactic acid and hypoxia reporter, cleavage reporter LR 01-03), negative control and positive control in a 24 well plates with 800 \u03bcL M9 medium (0.4% glucose) per well. The cell supernatant preserved at 200 \u03bcL was co-incubated with the above strains (the volume ratio of cell supernatant to M9 medium was 1:4). In the culture room connected to the CO2-O2 controller, hypoxia biosensors were tested with different levels of oxygen. All strains were cultured for 12 to 16 hours, and we measure the pixel intensity and absorbance of the reporters through microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The content of lactic acid and pH in the cell supernatant was calculated through the standard curve of the reporter strains 1 . Co-Culture of AE and LE Strains and Colorectal Cancer Cells in Vitro RKO cells were inoculated in 96 well plates (42 repeats) which containing 100 \u03bcl DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum cultured fluid (without phenol red). When RKO cells adherent grow, inoculating 10 \u03bcl of AR and LR strains (6 strains in total, 3 repeats, initial OD600 = 0.6) characterize the expression of lysis genes and bacterial growth density during co-culture of engineered AE strains with RKO cells. A CO2 incubator is used to adjust oxygen levels. Fluorescence intensity changes of the reporter were measured by a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) (every 20 min). We inoculate 10 \u03bcl of AE strains (Activators+ Effector 01, 3 strains in total, 3 repeats), control 1 (Effector 01, 1 strain, 3 repeats), control 2 (Activators, 3 strains, 3 repeats) and negative control (EcN, 1 strain, 3 repeats). Using the CCK8 kit (C0037, Beyotime, China) monitor cell viability changes (every 20 min)29. To investigate the effect of LE strain lysates on tumor cells, LE strains and their controls (lysis+/-, activators +/-) were induced overnight using cell supernatants on day 5 as described in method 4. Centrifugation at 10,000 rpm to collect the bacterial medium supernatant and preserved at -80\u00b0C. Subsequently, the cell lines were inoculated in 24 well plates containing 100 \u03bcl DMEM/10% fetal bovine serum cultured fluid (24 repeats). After the cells adhered to the wells, we add 10 \u03bcl of bacterial medium supernatant to the cell culture medium. Using the CCK8 kit detect cell viability after 1h incubation with bacterial lysates 2 . Bacterial adhesion analysis We add cell slides in 6 cm Petri dishes (Corning, USA), and cultivate CT26/RKO/SW480 cells 2 days in advance. Bacteria expressing INP-HlpA were activated with 5 mL test tubes a day in advance. Through centrifugation collect 5 mL of bacteria and resuspend with 2 mL of PBS. The PBS suspension was submerged in a 6 cm cell culture dish containing cell slides. After 1 h incubation at 37\u00b0C, discard the suspension and wash 3 times with PBS. Add 1 ml of DAPI working fluid (KeyGEN biotech, Jiangsu, China) to the culture dish, light avoidance incubation for 10 min, wash once with PBS, add buffer A dropwise on the microscope slide, and flip the cell slide onto the microscope slide. we observe the cell slides by using a fluorescence microscope Axio Imager. Z2 (ZEISS, Germany) with an excitation wavelength of 561 nm (corresponding to microscope AF546 wavelength), and the images were processed using imageJ 2.1.4.7.28. To quantify the amount of adherent bacteria, we dilute 10-7 for the washed down PBS suspension and apply it to LB plates for CFU counting 3 . Chien, T., et al.

Based on the above principle of lactate manipulator, we used different promoter and RBS combinations instead of lldR promoter (figure1a). The response of lactate promoter mutant strains R1_V1 to R1_V10 was characterized by the normalized fluorescence intensity of mRFP. The results showed that R1_V10, the original version with hyperspank and spoVG, had the best fold change (figure 1b). We proceeded to test the response of R1_V10 to lactate and the results showed that it can respond to 10 mM lactate levels. Among others, LB broth does not interfere with the mRFP fluorometric measurement (figure 1c). Figure 1. Structure and experimental results of the lactate operator. Figure 1a: Combination of different promoters to optimize the lactate operator. Figure 1b: The response of different combinations of lactate operators with the addition of 10 nM lactate, pyruvate and equal amounts of distilled water, characterized by normalized fluorescence intensity. Figure 1c: Normalized fluorescence intensity of R1_V10 and control group under the 10mM and 0mM lactate. We then tested pH and hypoxia reporters, and the results not only showed that they can respond to conditions, but also indicated that E. coli Nissle 1917 is more suitable as a chassis organism compared to E. coli DH-5alpha (figure 2). Figure 2. pH and hypoxia reporters. Left imagine: Normalized fluorescence values measured over 48 hours for a pH reporter consisting of pCadC and mRFP. Right imagine: Normalized fluorescence values measured over 77 hours for a hypoxia reporter consisting of pPepT and mRFP After confirming that promoters can respond to the signal properly, we start to verify the functionality of the switch. We compared the three promoters followed by mRFP with the strains with the addition of switch under the corresponding conditions of induction. According to the results as followed, by comparison, we can conclude that the addition of the amplifying genetic switch enhances the reporting strength and robustness of the biosensor (figure 3). Figure 3. Top row of graphs: Normalized fluorescence intensity of lactate, pH and hypoxia induced reporters (mRFP/Cell). Bottom row of graph: Normalized fluorescence intensity (mRFP/Cell) of lactate, pH and hypoxia induced reporters after the addition of switch (TP901 and XOR gate) We then co-cultured the engineered microbes with murine colorectal cancer cell lines CT26, and human colorectal cancer cells RKO and SW480, this time our engineered microbes are equipped with three biosensors and switch (XOR gate) followed by HlyE, respectively. Meanwhile, there were also strains transferred to only three promoters and HlyE parts were available as controls. From the results as followed, we can draw the conclusion that OR gate can enhance promoter-induced toxicity protein levels, and engineered microbes controlled by inducible promoters express active proteins only under low lactic acid and low pH conditions (figure 5) Figure 4. Cellular activity of engineered strains co-cultured with tumor cells at 0d and 3d Finally, we observed microscopically the EcN introduced with INP-HlpA and mRFP compared with the control group with mRFP only, and the results showed that the adhesion of EcN to colorectal cells could be effectively improved regardless of the type of tumor cells (figure 5).

Among them, CT26 and RKO magnify 400 times, while SW480 magnifies 300 times.","title":"Result"},{"location":"safety/","text":"PART Microorganisms In our project, only nonpathogenic strains (E. coli Nissle 1917 and E. coli DH5-alpha) were used as chassis microorganisms. In addition, to prevent the exposure and release of our engineered strains in the environment or their transfer by human carriage, we strictly follow the BSL1 safety guidelines during our experiments, and the specific safety measures we took can be found in our safety form. Circuit and Parts Most of the parts we chose to use this year were previously described by previous iGEM teams and have been shown to be harmless to humans, animals or plants. It is important to note that there are three potentially harmful parts: HlyE, CCL21 and CDD-iRGD in our submitted sequences, which were used for tumor cell killing as toxic proteins, and we have already registered them in the check-in form. To prevent the leakage of them, we designed the lactate operon, pH operon or hypoxia operon in the gene circuit to restrict them. At the same time, the inclusion of gene amplification switches ensures the robustness of these operons in the in vivo environment, allowing their precise targeting to the tumor. This gene circuit is designed such that HlyE, CCL21 and CDD-iRGD can only be expressed in the tumor environment without leakage. Furthermore, we expect to add an additional capsule coat to the exterior of the manufactured probiotic so that the drug does not start acting until after it enters the intestine, in order to again ensure the safety of the drug and prevent it from leaking before getting to the tumor. Environmental safety Considering that the engineered strains we constructed are resistant to kanamycin, ampicillin and chloramphenicol, if these microorganisms manage to leak into the environment, the spread of the resistance gene will cause genetic contamination. To avoid this, all people or objects that may come into contact with the engineered microorganisms will be disinfected with 75% alcohol or autoclaved before leaving the laboratory, which greatly prevents the escape of the microorganisms. In addition, even if these engineered strains are eventually used in clinical treatments, we have designed enough genetic parts to avoid its contamination of the environment. We added HlpA to make our E. coli adhere to tumor cells instead of spreading randomly in the human body. An arabinose induced killing switch was also introduced, which means that our engineered strains would die if arabinose was not present in the environment. It can only be allowed to exercise its function if it is induced by arabinose in the intestinal environment. All things considered, the engineered E. coli we used will not spread in the environment. Integrated Human Practice In order to identify prevalent social issues and to gain a broader understanding of public perceptions of colorectal cancer, we distributed questionnaires to the public and CRC patients, during which conversations, information collection and analysis were involved. In order to fulfill iGEMer's commitment to responsible ethical behavior, we followed the National Health Council, Ethical Approval Protocol for Biomedical Research Involving Humans, during the course of our activities. To this end, an informed consent form was prepared and presented at each questionnaire. We only administered the survey if the subject gave informed consent. Once the survey is completed, we ensure that the results are completely confidential and that all information is not disclosed to anyone outside of the research members of this project. All documents will be kept exclusively by team members and only team members will ha Our interview with the patient was launched at the First Hospital of Lanzhou University. We contacted Jiang Lei, the deputy chief physician of the Department of Oncology, who reported our case to the hospital's ethics committee, and we launched our activities only after the hospital's ethics committee agreed. Also, before meeting the patients we told them the purpose of our investigation and assured them that we would protect their personal privacy. If they felt uncomfortable during the process, they could leave at any time. Above all our behaviors strictly followed the \\<Ethics Approval Protocol of Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects> and \\<Human Genetic Resources Management Regulations of PRC>.ve access to them. Lab Experimental safety training and safety assurance As members of the biology community, we are well aware of the importance of experimental safety. Before we start the experiment, each of us was trained in laboratory skills, including but not limited to how to inoculate bacteria, how to use sterilization devices and how to do personal protection. So during our project, it greatly reduces risks of microbes' harm to human body. In the last day of our training, our supervisor will examine us, and those who fail will continue to study until they pass before being allowed to enter the lab. At the same time, our laboratory has posted the laboratory safety rules, and a person is responsible for the safety of our laboratory. His telephone number is posted on the wall of the laboratory, so that we can get in touch with him at any time. In addition to supervisors, our team also has counselors and instructors who advise us on safety issues throughout our experiments, and who are able to spot potential risks that we are not aware of. If we find some risks in the project, we will first seek help from the tutor and consultant. If we do not solve the problem well, we will seek help from the Experimental Safety Management Center of Lanzhou University, which can provide us with more effective solutions. Experimental Safety The laboratory we use is a level 1 standard microbiology laboratory, which is equipped with 3 biosafety cabinets, multiple chemical fume hoods and sterilizing pots. For the hazardous chemical, all of them are stored in separate locked cabinets\u3002When we handle toxic chemicals, we do so in a fume hood, wearing mask, gloves and safety goggles correctly. It is worth mentioning that these are all disposable and will be disposed them exclusively immediately after we are done using them. Not only that, but our lab is also specifically divided into EB contaminated areas, and all people entering the area will strictly wear masks and gloves. Outside our lab, there are many cabinets for us to keep our belongings, bags and clothes. Anything unrelated to the experiment is forbidden to be brought into the laboratory to prevent contamination. For usual personal protection, our laboratory provides sufficient disposable medical gloves and masks for each person to prevent inhalation of microorganisms. For the whole laboratory building access, People who want to enter the building must use their activated campus card, otherwise the door cannot be opened. Only those who have submitted and approved an application to the Lab Safety Center can have their campus card activated. For our laboratory access, we have updated the fingerprint and coded locks on the lab doors (can see it in picture we uploaded in the safety form) since we took over the lab. Only our team members can enter our laboratory. Emergency treatment Our laboratory is equipped with eye shower, emergency shower and medical first aid kit for emergencies. At the same time, there is a fire alarm button outside our laboratory, which can warn the whole laboratory members to escape safely in case of a fire. Waste treatment When we leave the lab, we need to disinfect our hands and all waste need to be sterilized. The office area and the experimental area are strictly separated. We are not allowed to touch the door handle with gloves. The laboratory has a standard air purification system for air filtration; We also carry out high-pressure sterilization for experimental wastes according to the standard. All these measurements can prevent GMOs unintentionally released into the environment. Education In order to promote synthetic biology and iGEM more widely, we conducted a questionnaire among minors. Before conducting the questionnaire, we obtained the consent from them and their guardians, and they were accompanied by their guardians in the whole process of participating in the activities, and their appearance was also approved by their guardians. The data information we obtain will not be disclosed to the public, only for data analysis. Permission was also obtained from their guardians before we uploaded their photos to our wiki page.
