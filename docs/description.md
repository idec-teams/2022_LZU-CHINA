According to the WHO GLOBOCAN database, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cancer in men and the second most common cancer in women, with 1.8 million new cases and
approximately 881,000 deaths worldwide in 20181. Despite the treatment of cancer, many results
have been achieved, all these approaches have their challenges and limitations in the field of cancer
therapy. Nonspecific toxicity to normal cells is one of the main challenges of conventional cancer
therapy. In addition, some chemotherapeutic agents can lead to the formation of multidrug-resistant
cells.2,3

Recent work has demonstrated that microorganisms injected directly intravenously can grow
selectively in tumors without adverse effects on host health4-6. Specifically, the ability of bacteria to
selectively home to tumors has increased the use of microbes as therapeutic or diagnostic
possibilities7.

In order to construct a bacterial biosensor system that can distinguish the unique organ environment,
oxygen, pH and lactic acid are considered as unique indicators of colorectal cancer tumor tissue.
Three operons were used to specifically recognize oxygen, pH and lactic acid. pPepT is used to
sense oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, FNR binds to the \[4Fe-4S\]^{2+} cluster to generate
homologous dimers. However, in the presence of oxygen, \[4Fe-4S\]^{2+} clusters are degraded,
resulting in the dissociation of FNR dimers into inactive monomers8. L-lactic acid induction is based
on lldPRD operon9.The lactic acid sensing system consists of two parts. pLldP drives the expression
of interested genes. LldR repressor binds to pLldP to inhibit the expression of reporter genes, unless
bound to lactic acid10,11. The pH-sensitive promoter pCadC, regulated by CadC, exhibits higher
activity in acidic media than in neutral pH media.
